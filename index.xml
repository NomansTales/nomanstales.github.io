      <description>Our Start Noman&#39;s Tales started as a single bedtime story (&#34;Four Brother Sheep&#34;) that was created to teach an important, Biblical lesson to our son. Upon further reflection, we realized that there was value in recording it for our family and others who shared our values. This realization inspired us to compile it with imagery and audio, which became the first official work of Noman&#39;s Tales, with hopefully many more to come!</description>
