    <h2>Our Start</h2>
    <p class="center">Noman's Tales started as a single bedtime story (<a href="https://nomanstales.com/books/four-brother-sheep/">"Four Brother Sheep"</a>) that was created to teach an important, Biblical lesson to our son.  Upon further reflection, we realized that there was value in recording it for our family and others who shared our values.  This realization inspired us to compile it with imagery and audio, which became the first official work of Noman's Tales, with hopefully many more to come!</p>
    <br>
    <p class="center">Given all the turmoil and false, ungodly teaching in the world; for the sake of our lineage, we want to ensure that we clearly define and explain the truths of God’s Word that have been imparted to us in a way that they can understand from a young age. Our great desire is to see all of them place faith in Christ, repent of their sins, love the Lord, serve His Church, make disciples, and teach these things to their children.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="center">To our readers, may God bless you and your families that you find unending hope, joy, and peace with Christ.</p>

    <h2>Our Values</h2>
    <p>
      <ol>
	<li><b>Love God with all our hearts, souls, minds, and strength</b> - We are driven us to create quality content, goods, and services for His glory.</li>

	<li><b>Love our neighbors as ourselves</b> - We are driven to treat all customers and employees with the same kindness, patience, and love that we would desire for ourselves; even when they might not reciprocate.</li>
	
	<li><b>Patterns of excellence, not perfection</b> - No person, service, or product will ever be perfect; however, we can continually strive to become better and better as a pattern of our lives and business practices.</li>
